			"The Altmer, or self-titled 'Cultured People', are a tall, golden-skinned race, hailing from Summerset Isle. They are also known as High Elves by the denizens of Tamriel.  In the Empire, 'High' is often understood to mean proud or snobbish, and as the Altmer generally personify these characteristics, the 'lesser races' generally resent them.  Altmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Altmer being old and a 300-year-old Altmer being very, very old.  Altmer consider themselves to be the most civilized culture of Tamriel; the common tongue of the continent is based on Altmer speech and writing, and most of the Empire's arts, crafts, laws, and sciences are derived from Altmer traditions." &mdash; <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer" target="_blank">UESP</a>

			The Bosmer are the Elven clan-folk of Valenwood, a forested province in southwestern Tamriel.  In the Empire, they are often referred to as Wood Elves, but Bosmer, Boiche, or the Tree-Sap people is what they call themselves.  Bosmer rejected the stiff, formal traditions of Aldmeri high culture, preferring a more romantic, simple existence in harmony with the land and its wild beauty and creatures. They are relatively nimble and quick in body compared to their more 'civilized' Altmeri cousins (who often look down upon the Bosmer as unruly and naive). Their agility makes them well-suited as scouts and thieves.  However, they are also a quick-witted folk, and many pursue successful careers in scholarly pursuits or trading.  Bosmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Bosmer being old and a 300-year-old Bosmer being very, very old. &mdash; <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bosmer" target="_blank">UESP</a>

			"Bretons are the human descendants of the Aldmeri-Nedic Manmer of the Merethic Era and are now the inhabitants of the province of High Rock.  They are united in culture and language, even though they are divided politically, for High Rock is a fractious region.  Bretons make up the peasantry, soldiery, and magical elite of the feudal kingdoms that compete for power.  Many are capable mages with innate resistance to magicka.  They are known for a proficiency in abstract thinking and unique customs.  Bretons appear, by and large, much like other pale-skinned humans.

			"The Dunmer, also known as Dark Elves, are the ash-skinned, typically red-eyed elven peoples of Morrowind.  'Dark' is commonly understood as meaning such characteristics as 'dark-skinned', 'gloomy', 'ill-favored by fate' and so on.  The Dunmer and their national identity, however, embrace these various connotations with enthusiasm.  In the Empire, 'Dark Elf' is the common usage, but among their Aldmeri brethren they are called 'Dunmer'.  Their combination of powerful intellects with strong and agile physiques produce superior warriors and sorcerers.  On the battlefield, Dunmer are noted for their skill with a balanced integration of the sword, the bow and destruction magic.  Dunmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Dunmer being old and a 300-year-old Dunmer being very, very old.  In character, they are grim, aloof, and reserved, as well as distrusting and disdainful of other races." &mdash; <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer" target="_blank">UESP</a>
