	<h2>ESO Rollplay - Player's Guide</h2>
	<section>
		<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		<p>
			Once you've created an account, you will be taken to a Dashboard screen, where you can create your first character.  There is a Help button at the top of the Character Sheet page that will help guide you through the process.  Once you've made your first character, you can return to the Dashboard by clicking the <em>ESO Rollplay</em> title at the top of the screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Back at the Dashboard, you will see a list of the characters you have made.  You can click on any of them to view their stat sheet, as well as enabling options to Play, Edit, or Delete the character.  The Edit and Delete options function like you would expect.  The Play option lets your character join an active Rollplay session.  You will need a session set up by a Game Master to use the rest of this guide!
		</p>
		<h3>The Rollplay Session</h3>
		<p>
			This is where you'll participate in the rolling mechanics of roleplay.  This is a supplement to the onscreen action, so it may be more convenient to access it from a mobile device rather than your PC.

	</section>
	<section>
		<h3><a name="local-status">Local Status</a></h3>
		<p>
			This is the section of the screen that is at the top when viewing on mobile, or on the left hand side when viewing on PC.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Load Session</strong> Button &mdash;
				This button will usually be unnecessary, but if your Game Master doesn't have a session ready for you yet, you will receive a <em>"This character is not part of an active roleplaying session. Check with your Game Master."</em> error when you enter this screen.  You can use the Load Session button to try to join again.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Your Character</strong> &mdash;
				This is a simple readout of your character's stats.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Character Info</strong> &mdash;
				This section will let you edit your character's current status.  You can set your equipped weapon and armor here.  If your character has a <a href="./supernatural.html">supernatural type</a> that's capable of transforming, you can initiate a transformation here as well.  You will need to wait for the Game Master to confirm your transformation.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Party</strong> &mdash;
				This section displays the players in the party and their summoned creatures.  Entries are color coded according to their <a href="./rolling.html#injury-system">injury status</a>.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3><a name="session-history">Session History</a></h3>
		<p>
			Next up on mobile, or on the upper right when on PC, is the Session History panel.  This shows you the events that have transpired so far in the Rollplay session.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3><a name="rolling-controls">Rolling Controls</a></h3>
		<p>
			The final panel on mobile, or the bottom right on PC, is for rolling controls.  This is the main area you will use to interact with the Rollplay Session.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Make a Roll!</strong> &mdash;
				This is the section you will use most often for initiating rolls of your own.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>Roll Using</em> - Choose the skill or attribute you will be using for the roll you want to make.  This list is pretty daunting, but it is sorted to show the skills you've invested points in first.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Roll!</em> Button - This button will initiate a plain roll against your chosen skill or attribute.  This is what you will use to make rolls like <a href="./skills.html#perception">Perception</a> against hidden enemies, or Strength to move heavy objects.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Attack!</em> Button - This button will initiate <a href="./rolling.html#combat">an attack</a> against the target you have selected in the adjacent dropdown.  This option should only be used when the action you are taking causes harm to its target.  If you want to, say, use <a href="./magicka.html#illusion">Illusion</a> to confuse an enemy, use the <em>Roll!</em> button instead.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Summoning</strong> &mdash;
				This section is used for summoning and controling creatures.  You may only have one summoned creature at a time.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>If no creature has been summoned</em> - You can use the dropdown to select the type of creature you'd like to summon.  Beneath the dropdown is a place to enter the summoned creature's name, if you'd like to provide one.  Finally, the <em>Summon!</em> button will initiate the summoning.  You will need to make a roll depending on the type of creature summoned, and then the Game Master will decide if the summoning succeeded.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Once a creature has been summoned</em> - You can direct the summon to attack a target using the <em>Attack!</em> button and its adjacent dropdown.  You can also use the <em>Dismiss</em> button when you no longer want your summoned creature.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Player vs. Player</strong> &mdash;
				This section is used for attacking other players or their pets.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>Roll Using</em> - Choose the skill or attribute you will be using for the attack roll, just like in the <i>Make a Roll</i> section.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Attack!</em> Button - This button will initiate <a href="./rolling.html#combat">an attack</a> against the player or pet you have selected on the right.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Attack with Pet!</em> Button - This button is only visible if you have summoned a creature.  It directs your summoned pet to attack the player or pet you have selected on the right.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Enemies</strong> &mdash;
				This section will display the enemies your party is currently aware of.  Just as in the Party list, entries are color coded according to their <a href="./rolling.html#injury-system">injury status</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Lazy Mode</strong> &mdash;
				Don't want to click through the Rolling Popup whenever you need to make a roll?  No problem!  Lazy Mode will automatically complete your rolls and submit them immediately.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3><a name="rolling-popup">Rolling Popup</a></h3>
		<p>
			You will see this popup when you need to make a roll.  It will provide a short message about what you're rolling, as well as a comment from the GM if applicable.  You can enter your own comment before rolling.  If you initiated the roll yourself, you also have the option of canceling the roll.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you roll, You will see the result of your roll, and then an <em>Ok</em> button will appear for you to complete your roll and submit it to the GM.
